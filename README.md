# Note
The source code for this is horrible, it is now unused and depracated thanks to Unbound DNS Server.
# How to build
Get the Grass7 API first, put into correct location and build the project.
Copy dnssetting1.bat and dnssetting2.bat to system32 of the target system.
Configure a scheduled task, this program should activate it via options.
